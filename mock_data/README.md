This package creates a mock dataset of legitimate and fraudulent transactions (and other session actions) with rich structure. Specifically, different customers will have different data distributions from each other, and the average data distribution of legit customers will differ from that of fraudsters (who are impersonating legitimate customers by using their accounts). Features can be derived from a separate customer-level information table, other records in the same session, and deviations from typical historical behaviour of the customer.
